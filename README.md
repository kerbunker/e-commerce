# E-Commerce

## Description

This back-end application uses sequelize to connect to a database where merch items can be stored. The user has access to products, categories of products, and tags that can be used to describe products. These products, tags, and categories can be retrieved, created, updated, and deleted.

## Installation

To install the application, the files need to be downloaded from the github repository, and then the command "npm install" is run to get the necessary packages. A .env file can be created for access to mysql.

## Usage

After the installation, the command "npm run seed" can be used to seed the merch data and then the command "npm start" can be run to start the server. The data can then be accessed through http://localhost:3001.
